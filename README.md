# PostgreSQL Solution Accelerator: Build your own AI Copilot / FSI Scenario

In the financial services industry (FSI), validating financial documents, like contracts, statements of work (SOWs), and invoices poses distinct challenges. This is particularly true when it comes to ensuring that invoices align with SOWs, especially for milestone-based payments and other specific deliverables. Traditionally, this validation process is manual, requiring meticulous comparison and cross-checking, often leading to delays, errors, and elevated operational costs. This accelerator explores a high-level architectural solution utilizing Microsoft Azure's comprehensive suite of AI services to automate and streamline this process, resulting in faster, more accurate, and cost-effective invoice validation.
