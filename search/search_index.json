The App Scenario","text":"<p>In the financial services industry, validating contracts, statements of work (SOWs), and invoices poses distinct challenges. This is particularly true when it comes to ensuring that invoices align with SOWs, especially for milestone-based payments and other specific deliverables. Traditionally, this validation process is manual, requiring meticulous comparison and cross-checking, often leading to delays, errors, and elevated operational costs. This article explores a high-level architectural solution utilizing Microsoft Azure's comprehensive suite of services to automate and streamline this process, resulting in faster, more accurate, and cost-effective invoice validation.</p> <p>The workshop teaches you to build, evaluate, and deploy a financial services copilot on Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Azure AI. The application scenario involves an enterprise frontend (User Portal) integrated with a custom copilot backend (API app), to provide data management and a chat-based customer support experience to users.

The RAG Pattern","text":"<p>The workshop teaches you to build, evaluate, and deploy a retail copilot code-first on Azure AI - using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) design pattern to make sure that our copilot responses are grounded in the (private) data maintained by the enterprise, for this application.</p> <p></p> <p>Let's learn how this design pattern works in the context of our Contoso Chat application. Click on the tabs in order, to understand the sequence of events shown in the figure above.</p> 1. Get Query2. Vectorize Query3. Retrieve Matches4. Augment Query5. Generate Response <p>The user query arrives at our copilot implementation via the endpoint (API)</p> <p>Our deployed Contoso Chat application is exposed as a hosted API endpoint using Azure Container Apps. The inoming \"user query\" has 3 components: the user question (text input), the user's customer ID (text input), and an optional chat history (object array).</p> <p>The API server extracts these parameters from the incoming request, and invokes the Contoso Chat application - starting the workflow reflecting this RAG design pattern.</p> <p>The copilot sends the text query to a retrieval service after first vectorizing it.</p> <p>The Contoso Chat application converts the text question into a vectorized query using a Large Language \"Embedding\" Model (e.g., Azure Open AI <code>text-embedding-ada-002</code>). This is then sent to the information retrieval service (e.g., Azure AI Search) in the next step.</p> <p>The retrieval service uses vectorized query to return matching results by similarity</p> <p>The information retrieval service maintains a search index for relevant information (here, for our product catalog). In this step, we use the vectorized query from the previous step to find and return matching product results based on vector similarity. The information retrieval service can also use features like semantic ranking to order the returned results.</p> <p>The copilot augments user prompt with retrieved knowledge in request to model</p> <p>The Contoso Chat application combines the user's original question with returned \"documents\" from the information retrieval service, to create an enhanced model prompt. This is made easier using prompt template technologies (e.g., Prompty) with placeholders - for chat history, retrieved documents, and customer profile information - that are filled in at this step.</p> <p>The chat model uses prompt to generate a grounded response to user question.</p> <p>This enhanced prompt is now sent to the Large Language \"chat\" model (e.g., Azure OpenAI <code>gpt-35-turbo</code> or <code>gpt-4o</code>) which sees the enhanced prompt (retrieved documents, customer profile data, chat history) as grounding context for generating the final response, improving the quality (e.g., relevance, groundedness) of results returned from Contoso Chat.</p>"},{"location":"01-Introduction/03-App-Architecture/","title":"3. The App Architecture","text":"<p>The objective of this solution is to automate the extraction, validation, and storage of invoices and SOWs to minimize manual effort and boost operational efficiency. This solution architecture facilitates seamless integration across multiple Azure services, ensuring scalability, security, and optimized costs, while accurately aligning invoices with milestone-based deliverables and other contractual obligations.</p> <p>The high-level solution architecture is represented by this diagram:</p> <p></p> <p>Click on each tab to understand the archtiecture components and processing workflow.</p> 1. Architecture Components2. Processing Services <p>The architecture has these core components:</p> <ul> <li>Azure AI Search \u2192 the information retrieval service (product index)</li> <li>Azure Database for PostgreSQL \u2192 the database (customer profile, order history)</li> <li>Azure OpenAI \u2192 the model deployments (embedding, chat, eval)</li> <li>Azure Container Apps \u2192 the app hosting service (API endpoint)</li> <li>Azure Managed Identity \u2192 for keyless authentication (trustworthy AI)</li> </ul> <p>The Architecture \"processes\" incoming user requests received on the hosted API endpoint by taking the following steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Data Ingestion: SOWs, invoices and other related documents are ingested via a custom REACT web application. Internal users and external vendors can submit documents by uploading them through the web app, which then uploads them to Azure Blob Storage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Workflow Trigger Mechanism: Upon receipt of new documents, an event trigger activates Python-based background worker processes:</p> <p>a. Data Extraction and Processing: Azure's OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology digitizes content from uploaded documents, such as SOWs and invoices.</p> <p>b. Document Intelligence (Custom Model): A custom AI model within Azure's Document Intelligence service is tailored to extract specific data fields, like payment milestones, dates, amounts, and vendor details. This model is trained to recognize the structure of financial documents, improving data extraction accuracy.</p> <p>c. Confidence Scoring and Validation: Each document is assigned a confidence score based on whether the documents contain the correct sections and fields.</p> <p>d. Validation Using Azure OpenAI: Azure OpenAI language models, such as GPT-4o, are used to review all document data, employing natural language understanding to validate and cross-check information, ensuring high data integrity. The language model is used to cross-reference data between invoices and SOWs, evaluating payment milestone completion and billing, and preventing issues like payment delays. It also validates that appropriate compliance language exists in contracts and SOWs, helping to avoid compliance violations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secure Storage and Database Management: Validated data is chunked, vectorized using an Azure OpenAI embedding model, and stored in an encrypted Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server database, which uses vector embeddings for advanced search and retrieval. This supports efficient handling of structured and semi-structured data, facilitating downstream analytics. Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server supports JSON-based semi-structured data and vector embedding storage, enabling AI-enhanced queries. Embeddings can be generated directly from database queries using the Azure AI extension for PostgreSQL.</p> </li> <li> <p>Document enrichment: The Azure AI extension for PostreSQL also enables data to be enhanced using Azure AI Services directly from the database. This capability provides rich AI functionality, such as text translation and entity and keyword extraction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Copilot chat: An Azure OpenAI + LangChain copilot enables project managers and leadership to quickly get metrics, trends and processing timelines for contracts, SOWs, invoices, and vendors using a user friendly chat interface. Function calling via LangChain tools enables the copilot to implement a RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) pattern over data in the PostgreSQL database, using vector search to efficiently retrieve relevant documents and data.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"01-Introduction/04-App-Lifecycle/","title":"4.

This includes creating the Azure AI project (resources, models) and support services (Azure CosmosDB, Azure AI Search, Azure Container Apps). By the end of this step, you should have created an Azure resource group.</p> <p>This step is completed for you in instructor-led sessions.</p> <p>Setup the development environment for your project. This involves forking the sample repo to your own profile, launching GitHub Codespaces to get a pre-built development environment and configure it to talk to your provisioned Azure infrastructure. By the end of this step, you should be ready to start the ideation step of development.</p> <p>Go from first prompt to functional prototype. This involves creating a prompt template, configuring it to use a deployed chat model, then using a sample input to iterate on the prompt template design till a satisfactory response is returned. By the end of this step, you should have a Prompty asset and a Python application script for Contoso Chat.</p> <p>Assess response quality with larger test dataset. This involves creating a test dataset, creating custom evalators (for quality metrics) and orchestrating an AI-assisted evaluation workflow to scores responses from our application before we can deploy to production. By the end of this step, you should be ready to take the prototype to production.</p> <p>Deploy application to get a hosted API endpoint. This involves creating an API application server (using FastAPI), packaging it up in am Azure Container App, and deploying it to Azure using <code>azd deploy</code>. By the end of this step, you should have a hosted Contoso Chat AI endpoint, ready to integrate with frontend clients.</p>"},{"location":"02-Setup/0-PreRequisites/","title":"Pre-Requisites","text":"<p>You must have a GitHub account to get started.

Let's see how it handles these requests:</p> <ul> <li>See: <code>@app.get(\"/\")</code> - requests to the default route (\"/\") get a \"Hello World\" health check message.</li> <li><code>@app.put(\"/api/create_response\")</code> - requests to this endpoint are parsed, with query parameters extracted and passed to the <code>get_response</code> function (copilot), with the response then returned to the caller.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"05-Deploy/05/#1-code-change-options","title":"1. Code Change Options","text":"<p>We can think of code changes being made at different stages of the processing workflow:</p> <ul> <li>Modify <code>src/main.py</code> - to change API endpoint routes or incoming request processing.</li> <li>Modify <code>chat_request.py</code> - to change how the <code>get_request</code> workflow is orchestrated. </li> <li>Modify <code>chat.prompty</code> - to change the model prompt behavior (template, configuration). </li> </ul> <p>Let's try the first option, and change how an incoming API request is handled.</p>"},{"location":"05-Deploy/05/#2-change-api-handler","title":"2. Change API handler","text":"<p>Let's change how the API server handles the health-check request on \"/\". This is a simple change that lets us validate automatic reload on the FastAPI server.</p> <ol> <li>Make sure the <code>fastapi dev src/main.py</code> command is still running</li> <li>Check: the browser is showing the \"/\" route on <code>*.github.dev</code> with \"Hello, World\"</li> <li>Open <code>src/api/main.py</code><ul> <li>Find  line 46 - should currently say: <code>return {\"message\": \"Hello World\"}</code></li> <li>Modify it to: <code>return {\"message\": \"Hello Microsoft AI Tour\"}</code></li> </ul> </li> <li>Return to the browser page above.<ul> <li>Check: The displayed message should have updated to \"Hello Microsoft AI Tour\"</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>CONGRATULATIONS.
